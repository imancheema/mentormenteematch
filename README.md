# mentormenteematch
This code uses the Greedy Algorithm to match mentees with mentors who best align with their shared traits, such as identity, communication style, major, and more. The goal is to save time, reduce errors compared to manual matching, and ensure compatible, meaningful mentorship connections.

## How it works: 
1. Input: Upload CSV files containing mentee and mentor data, including their traits and preferences.
2. Processing: Compatibility scores are calculated for each mentor-mentee pair by comparing their attributes.
3. Output: The system generates a list of mentor-mentee matches, ensuring everyone gets paired.
